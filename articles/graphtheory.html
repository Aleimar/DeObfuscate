                        <p><span class="firstcharacter" style="font-family: Futura;">G</span>raph theory is a mathematical field that studies graphs, which are made up of dots (vertices) 
                            and lines (edges) connecting them. Graphs can represent many things like social networks, transportation systems, or anything else where objects are connected to each other. 
                            Graph theory helps us understand how graphs work and what we can do with them. It has many practical uses in fields like computer science, biology, and economics
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-family: Futura;">
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the types of graphs?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are many types of graphs, and they can be classified based on their properties and characteristics. Here are some common types of graphs:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <list>
                                <ol>1. Directed graph: A type of graph where the edges have a specific direction or arrow, which means they represent a one-way relationship between vertices. 
                                    This means that if there is an edge from vertex A to vertex B, it does not necessarily mean that there is an edge from vertex B to vertex A.

                                </ol>

                                <ol>2. Undirected graph: A type of graph where the edges do not have a specific direction or arrow. This means that the relationship between vertices represented 
                                    by edges is two-way or bidirectional. If there is an edge between vertex A and vertex B, then there is also an edge between vertex B and vertex A.
                                </ol>

                                <ol>
                                    3. Weighted graph: A type of graph where each edge has a number assigned to it, which represents how important or strong the relationship is between the vertices connected by that edge. 
                                    The weight could represent something like distance, cost, or time, depending on the specific problem being modeled.
                                </ol>

                                <ol>
                                    4. Complete graph: A type of graph where every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex. This means that there is an edge between every pair of vertices in the graph. 
                                    So, if there are n vertices in the graph, then there are n*(n-1)/2 edges in total. It’s like a network where everyone is connected to everyone else.
                                </ol>

                                <ol>
                                    5. Bipartite graph: A type of graph where the vertices can be divided into two distinct groups or sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. 
                                    This means that there are no edges between vertices in the same set. It’s like having two separate groups of people or objects, and every relationship or connection is between a person 
                                    or object from one group and a person or object from the other group.
                                </ol>

                                <ol>
                                    6. Tree: A type of graph where you can only go from one vertex to another in one way, and you can’t follow a path that loops back to where you started.
                                </ol>

                                <ol>
                                    7. Planar graph: A type of graph that can be drawn on a flat surface (like a sheet of paper) without any edges crossing over each other.
                                </ol>

                                <ol>
                                    8. Eulerian graph: A type of graph where you can find a path that goes through every edge exactly once.
                                </ol>

                                <ol>
                                    9. Hamiltonian graph: A type of graph where you can find a path that goes through every vertex exactly once.
                                </ol>
                            </list>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These are just a few examples of the many types of graphs that exist. The type of graph that is appropriate for a 
                            particular application depends on the nature of the problem being modeled.
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-family: Futura;">
                            How can we determine what graph to use in a certain problem?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When choosing a graph type in graph theory, it’s important to consider what information you want to extract from the graph, 
                            what properties you want the graph to have, and what algorithms or techniques you plan to use to analyze the graph. 
                            It’s also important to make sure the graph type you choose accurately represents the problem and is suitable for the data you have.
